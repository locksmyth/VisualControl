Visual Control - Configure textures and visual elements.
Version: v0.1
Visual Control is a single plugin to specify unique texture packs, sun/moon images and other visual elements that you might want configured on a per-world basis.

Apparently I had the wrong jar file in my dropbox, that has been corrected now that I have updated the plugin. It now contains a basic command system. /vcset and /vcupdate see their details below. At the moment there is no support for permissions. That is the next goal.

previous notes said:
[8-15-2001]I wrote this for my own server because there wasn't anything else that did quite what I wanted, I see now that there are a few options, I will however add this to the pool.


Features:
Give each texture pack a title.
Specify a global default texture pack.
Specify separate texture packs per world.
Announce changing texture pack changes, or not.
Pick unique sun/moon image and size for each world.
Turn off the sun, moon, clouds and the stars.
Change the height of the cloud layer.

Commands
Code:
/vcset [world] <sun|moon|clouds|stars|use> <setting>
vcset is used to alter the configuration file from the chat bar.
If you do not specify a world it acts upon the current world.
To toggle the visibility of a sky element use on or off as the setting.
/vcset sun on
This will work for the sun, moon, clouds and stars.
To change the size of the sun or moon simply use a number between 0 - 200 as the setting
/vcset moon 150
To specify an image for the sun or moon supply the url as the setting
/vcset moon http://dl.dropbox.com/u/21888917/sunqu.png
To force the cloud layer to a different level
/vcset clouds 75
And similarly the change the frequency of stars
/vcset stars 1500


/vcupdate [player]
vcupdate will cause the selected player (or the caller is none is provided) to have the visuals of their current world forcibly updated. (I.E without a teleport/spawn event.)
